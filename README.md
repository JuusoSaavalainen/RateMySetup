Backend is a containerized <b>EC2 instance</b>, then free tier ran out so I hosted the frontend on <b>AWS amplify</b>

For image storage im using <b>Google cloud storage</b>

For the database im using <b>MongoDB atlas</b>

<b>For now users can</b>:
- Create an account and login
- Upload an image of their gaming/work setup and create a post
- Like / dislike other users posts

<b>TODO over the summer</b>:
- Bug fixes
- Commenting on posts
- Post editing
- Notifications (ex. post creation / login succeeded, login failed / failed to create a post error)
- UI improvements and style changes
- Mobile optimization
